Hegnel is an elderly dwarf (around 287 years of age). He is a cleric of Moradin, one of the last few remaining in southern Nethea. He has greying hair and rough craggy skin. The lower half of his face is obscured by a huge grey beard, braided with iron ornaments. His eyes are bright blue and peer out from underneath bushy brows. He tries to keep himself presentable but often has soil and mud on his clothes. He is missing the lower half of his right leg - he lost it many years ago in a fight with a troll. Hegnel usually wears an old but well maintained helm which has a decorative nose guard - once the helm was silvered but much of its polish has worn away. When relaxing he often smokes a small, antique, curved wooden pipe inlaid with ivory decorations.
