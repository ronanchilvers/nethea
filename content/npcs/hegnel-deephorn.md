Hegnel is an elderly dwarf (around 287 years of age). He is a cleric of Moradin, one of the last few remaining in southern Nethea. He has greying hair and rough craggy skin. The lower half of his face is obscured by a huge grey beard, braided with iron ornaments. His eyes are bright blue and peer out from underneath bushy brows. He tries to keep himself presentable but often has soil and mud on his clothes. He is missing the lower half of his right leg - he lost it many years ago in a fight with a troll. Hegnel usually wears an old but well maintained helm which has a decorative nose guard - once the helm was silvered but much of its polish has worn away. When relaxing he often smokes a small, antique, curved wooden pipe inlaid with ivory decorations.

# Key Moments

## Session 29

Glyndwr spotted Hegnel at a distance. The cleric was making his way through the crowd and stopped to observe Glyndwr, Rhogar, Alfred and Balinda as they entered Moltenor's.

## Session 30

Glyndwr and Rhogar met Hegnel when Glyndwr was recovering from making unwilling contact with a distressed human wolfkin mind. The cleric offered help - Glyndwr and Rhogar accompanied him to his dwelling where he introduced himself as a cleric of the ancient dwarven god Moradin. He told them he could tell that they were being pursued by a revenant or "hunter" as he called it. He told them that the only ways to destroy a "hunter" were either to evade it for a year and day or to extract its soul from the body it occupies and bless it.
