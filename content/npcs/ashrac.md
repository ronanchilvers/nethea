Ashrac is a dragonborn, around 70 years of age. He is of medium height (for a dragonborn) at around 6 feet and broadly built, although age is telling on him and his posture is quite bent. His reptilian skin resembles dull tarnished amber in colour and he has spines, many partially cracked or broken, jutting up from his forehead and sweeping back over his head. The right side of his face is scarred and melted as if by a terrible heat. His right eye is opaque and milky but his left is bright and changes in the light between dark brown and amber grey. He usually wears a long tunic of green or brown with breeches and knee high boots. He also routinely wears a cloak with a deep hood that covers his head and face.

Ashrac is a member of The Close, an organisation that seems to be dedicated to the downfall of the Revelation Church.
