Ashrac is a dragonborn, around 70 years of age. He is of medium height (for a dragonborn) at around 6 feet and broadly built, although age is telling on him and his posture is quite bent. His reptilian skin resembles dull tarnished amber in colour and he has spines, many partially cracked or broken, jutting up from his forehead and sweeping back over his head. The right side of his face is scarred and melted as if by a terrible heat. His right eye is opaque and milky but his left is bright and changes in the light between dark brown and amber grey. He usually wears a long tunic of green or brown with breeches and knee high boots. He also routinely wears a cloak with a deep hood that covers his head and face.

Ashrac is a member of The Close, an organisation that seems to be dedicated to the downfall of the Revelation Church.

# Key Moments

## Session 31

Malakai arranged for Ashrac to meet the party after Alfred asked if there was someone who would be able to give them information about some artifacts they had discovered. When Alfred, Valerian and Balinda arrived at the tavern, Ashrac was waiting for them, seated in a private corner. He was wearing his hood to try to avoid notice. Alfred revealed that they had come into possession of two artifacts, caged metal cubes. Ashrac seemed startled at the description and asked for proof that they had these things. Alfred showed him the cube which Balinda had stolen earlier in the evening - Ashrac's demeanour changed and he asked to speak to them privately, whereupon they took him to their rooms in the back of the tavern.

Ashrac revealed that he is a member of The Close, the organisation that the party was sent to contact. He also revealed that the metal cubes are known as Soul Harrows and are distributed by the Revelation Church to some of their clerics. These clerics, often under the pretence of running hospitals, soup kitchens or other community services, use the Soul Harrows to suck the life force from selected victims - both the soul and the mind combined as one. The devices are then regularly brought to a major temple such as the one in Fallshire, in Dachis, Ostia or in Kapechi, Berania. Ashrac revealed that a device known only as a Spirit Reaver is then used to tear apart the life force from the mind, storing the former and discarding the latter as waste. Ashrac and the Close have discovered that the stored life force is being used to create a new race of creatures - lizard like and cruel - that turn to stone and poison their attackers with gas when killed.

Lastly Ashrac revealed that the Revelation Church's activities seem to be causing a weakening of the veil between the different planes of reality. He believed it likely that the phenomenon seen by Alfred and Valerian, the tearing of space, is a symptom of that weakening.
