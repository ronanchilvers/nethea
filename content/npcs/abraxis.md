Abraxis is a minotaur warrior and reigning champion of "The Court of Honour", the pit fighting tournament run by {{< npc "Kit Moltenor" >}}. He has convincingly won the last three tournaments and it looks like he is intending to win his fourth title. He is a huge figure, standing over 9 feet in height with huge curved horns jutting from his head, bands of rippling muscle running over his bull like shoulders, chest and back. He wears worn leather trousers, decorated with steel knee caps and bands of steel around the tops of his hooves. Shaggy black hair runs in thick mane over the top of his head and down his back, disappearing behind the straps of a battered breastplate. He wears silver rings in his nose and in his long ears. His eyes are small, wide set and black.

When he is not competing in pit fights, Abraxis can usually be found somewhere in the area of the Patchwork Market. He commonly spends his time drinking and gambling, preferring to wager on games which don't need much skill.
